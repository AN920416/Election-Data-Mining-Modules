         "2024-12-04",
         "President Joe Biden sent a heartfelt letter to ESPN “College GameDay” football analyst Kirk Herbstreit after his adored golden retriever, Ben, died of cancer last month. “I was so sorry to hear about the loss of your beloved Ben,” Biden said in the November 22 note. “Ben brought so much comfort and unconditional love to millions of Americans across our Nation. “In your most joyful moments and most grief-stricken days, he was there, sensitive to every unspoken feeling and emotion.” Herbstreit shared the letter and his gratitude to Biden on social media Wednesday. “Politics aside-REALLY honored to receive this personal note from @POTUS sharing his appreciation and compassion for the loss of our beloved Ben. I can only hope that Ben knows how many people he touched.” A certified emotional service animal, Ben became famous for his infectious, friendly nature while in the national spotlight each week. He caused uncontrollable “oohs-and-ahs” while accompanying Herbstreit around the country covering football. Ben — who had been with Herbstreit for 10 years — would often be seen on set during live productions. The long-time ESPN commentator would also bring his cherished dog along for his “Thursday Night Football” on Prime Video gig. Ben had taken ill this year and was diagnosed with leukemia in March and underwent surgery in July, according to ESPN. “I know what it is like to lose a beloved pet, and I hope you can find some comfort in cherishing the beautiful memories you shared with Ben,” Biden continued. “He was a good boy.” In June 2021, the Bidens announced that Champ, their “beloved” German Shepherd, who had been with their family since 2008, had died.

         "Biden wraps historic Africa trip overshadowed by domestic and geopolitical controversies | CNN Politics",
         "2024-12-04",
         "President Joe Biden grinned as he posed for photos with the leader of Angola before departing the country Wednesday, capping off an historic trip that was overshadowed by controversy stemming from Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter and unexpected turmoil from a key US ally. Over the three-day trip, the first for an American president, Biden promoted US investment in a massive railway project aiming to ease the transport of critical minerals to global markets as his administration attempts to make lasting inroads on the continent in the face of China’s growing influence. The president acknowledged the horrific history of slavery while speaking in a country that was a major departure point for millions of enslaved Africans to places like America. And he declared the US as “all-in on Africa” as he finally made good on a two-year promise to visit sub-Saharan Africa. But back in Washington, Biden’s Sunday night announcement that he issued a pardon to his only living son became a major flashpoint as members of his own Democratic Party responded with a flood of criticism. Biden did not answer any questions relating to the pardon despite multiple inquiries by reporters traveling with him. On the second day of Biden’s trip, the unexpected move by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to declare martial law before reversing course hours later after pressure from parliament also stole the spotlight. The president and US officials were surprised by the decision, leaving his teams in Angola and back in Washington scrambling to determine what was happening and what would come next. While on the trip, Biden did not substantively weigh in on the matter, only briefly telling reporters he would receive a briefing on the situation involving a key US ally. The president also decided to forgo a formal news conference – an event that used to be standard when a president travels abroad but has become a rarity in the final months of Biden’s presidency. The trip comes as the president is preparing to exit the world stage with President-elect Donald Trump preparing his return as commander-in-chief. Many world leaders are not waiting for Trump’s inauguration to start talks with the president-elect, heading to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for meetings or even hosting Trump in their country – as French President Emmanuel Macron prepares to do this weekend for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. Even as the world turns its eye to Trump, Biden is hoping his moves in Africa could have lasting impact, with a senior administration official saying their strategy could be a “playbook” for future administrations. The Lobito Corridor, which will transport critical minerals from interior countries like Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to ports in Angola and Tanzania, is at the center of the Biden administration’s strategy in Africa. On his final day in Angola, the president toured the port of Lobito, examining American-made General Electric trains used to carry cargo along the railway before meeting with regional leaders for an official Lobito Corridor Trans-Africa Summit. A senior administration official described the railway project as a “test case” of their approach – trying to surge in American support and financing in a direct way to a specific corridor “where we can have the largest impact,” instead of splitting up funds across a host of countries. Senior administration officials said the corridor will significantly speed up movement of critical minerals, which would be available for export to the US. It currently takes about 45 days for a cargo of cobalt or copper to get from eastern DRC or Zambia to the market by going to Durban, South Africa, by truck. The railway would significantly slash that shipment time to 40 to 50 hours to go the same distance. “It’s a game-changer. Imagine how transformative this will be for technology, clean energy, for farming, for food security as a whole. It’s faster, it’s cleaner, it’s cheaper and most importantly, I think, it’s just plain common sense,” Biden said as he met with Angolan President João Lourenço, Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema and Tanzanian Vice President Philip Mpango. Biden announced that the US will invest an additional $560 million for projects along the Lobito corridor, from continued infrastructure upgrades to helping build mobile networks. The White House has said those projects will generate at least $200 million in additional private sector commitments. The US Development Finance Corporation also has approved a $553 million direct loan for the railway. The push comes as the Biden administration has tried to ramp up its work in Africa, including $4 billion in US investments in the Lobito Corridor, as China has built up influence in the continent, leaving the US to play to catch up. Beijing has been a major player in Africa for the past decade through its own Belt and Road Initiative, which has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into railways, highways and other infrastructure projects across the continent. During a speech at the National Museum of Slavery in Luanda on Tuesday, the president took a swipe at China’s approach, without naming the country, arguing the US presents a better alternative. “The United States understands how we invest in Africa is as important as how much we invest,” Biden said Tuesday. “In too many places, 10 years after the so-called investment was made, workers are still coming home on a dirt road and without electricity, a village without a school, a city without a hospital, a country under crushing debt. We seek a better way, transparent, high standard, open access to investment that protects workers and the rule of law and the environment. It can be done and will be done,” the president said. The government of Angola, which has worked to move closer to the US under its current president after decades of ties to China and Russia, has played up the US collaboration and investments throughout Biden’s trip. Large billboards were scattered across the capital of Luanda welcoming Biden, picturing him shaking hands with Lourenço. “Strengthening ties, building bridges,” read one of them. But people like 34-year-old Antonio, who works as a driver in the capital city, don’t think any of the supposed economic gains of a closer partnership with the US will trickle down to the bottom as it will take several years before the Lobido Corridor project will be fully operational. “People are wondering what is going to come of all of this,” he said. Alexandra, 27, works in an office in downtown Luanda and she, too, is skeptical. “All this fanfare — and we hear the economy is doing better — but people don’t feel it in their wallets,” Alexandra said. But the Biden administration is hoping the investments the US is making now will pay off for the people of Africa in the years to come. “I think we’re at one of those transition points in world history. What we do in the next several years are going to affect what the next six, seven, eight decades looks like,” Biden said. “I think this is one of those milestones.” And Biden, whose more than five-decades-long political career is about to come to end, is promising to return to Africa. “I’m coming back to ride on the train all the way, end to end,” Biden said as he wrapped his final event in Angola. “I like trains a lot, so I’m coming back. You’re stuck with me.”"

         "Judge in Hunter Biden’s tax case blasts Joe Biden for ‘rewriting history’ with son’s pardon | CNN Politics",
         "2024-12-03",
         "The federal judge who oversaw Hunter Biden’s tax case blasted President Joe Biden for trying to “rewrite history” in his justification for pardoning his son. District Judge Mark Scarsi wrote in a five-page order Tuesday that some of the “representations contained” in the president’s Sunday statement announcing the pardon “stand in tension with the case record.” Scarsi specifically took issue with Biden’s rationale that his son’s tax problems were all caused by his struggle with alcohol and drug addiction. “The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States … but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history,” Scarsi wrote. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in September to nine tax offenses, stemming from $1.4 million in taxes that he didn’t pay. He was also convicted by a jury in June of illegally buying and possessing a gun as a drug user. The president’s pardon explicitly granted clemency for the tax and gun offenses from Hunter Biden’s existing cases, plus any potential federal crimes he may have committed “from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.” In the pardon announcement Sunday night, Joe Biden claimed his son was one of many Americans “who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions.” But, as the judge pointed out, as part of Hunter Biden’s guilty plea, he admitted to not paying his tax debts even after regaining his sobriety, and even though he had the funds to pay. The judge also rebuked the president for claiming his son was “singled out” for prosecution because of political reasons. Earlier this year, Scarsi rejected this exact argument from Hunter Biden, who wanted the indictment tossed on those grounds. (The judge in Hunter Biden’s gun case also rejected the selective-prosecution theory.) Joe Biden’s announcement claimed “no reasonable person” could conclude this wasn’t a politically motivated prosecution. But Scarsi noted plenty of Justice Department officials, including the attorney general, oversaw the case — and therefore, “in the President’s estimation, this legion of federal civil servants … are unreasonable people.” Scarsi, who is a respected and no-nonsense jurist, was appointed by Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate in a bipartisan vote in 2020. He said he will formally terminate the proceedings in the tax case once he is provided with an authorized copy of the pardon paperwork. Meanwhile, the judge who oversaw Hunter Biden’s gun case said in an order Tuesday that “all proceedings in this case are hereby terminated.” Hunter Biden’s attorneys had asked the judge, Maryellen Noreika, to formally dismiss the charges, instead of simply terminating or shutting down future proceedings. Special counsel David Weiss, who brought the two federal cases, argued “termination” instead of “dismissal” was the appropriate way to end the case, saying that’s how cases for other pardoned defendants were handled. Prosecutors in Weiss’ office also wanted the indictments to survive as originally filed, instead of being formally dismissed."

         "Biden acknowledges horrific history of slavery that has connected the US and Angola while projecting optimism for future ties | CNN Politics",
         "2024-12-03",
         "President Joe Biden on Tuesday acknowledged how the horrific history of slavery has connected the United States and Angola while delivering a hopeful vision for the future in a major speech from a country that was the point of departure for millions of enslaved Africans. “Our people lie at the heart of a deep and profound connection that forever binds Africa and the United States together. We remember the stolen men and women and children who were brought to our shores in chains and subjected to unimaginable cruelty,” Biden said in remarks at the National Museum of Slavery, which is built near the chapel where enslaved individuals were forcibly baptized before being sent to America. The museum was built on the property of Álvaro de Carvalho Matoso, one of the largest slave traders on the African coast. Biden told the attendees that he’s proud to be the first president to visit Angola and that he’s “deeply optimistic” about the future relationship between the nation and the US. “The story of Angola and the United States holds a lesson for the world. Two nations with a shared history, an evil of human bondage. Two nations on the opposite sides of the Cold War, the defining struggle of the late part of the 20th century. And now, two nations standing shoulder to shoulder working together every day,” he said. “It’s a reminder that no nation need be permanently the adversary of another.” Biden’s trip aimed to highlight US investments in Angola and the continent in the face of deepening Chinese influence in the region, as Beijing has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into Africa through its Belt and Road Initiative. Biden took a swipe at China’s moves, without calling out the country by name, and argued the US presents a better alternative. “The United States understands how we invest in Africa is as important as how much we invest,” Biden said. “In too many places, 10 years after the so-called investment was made, workers are still coming home on a dirt road and without electricity, a village without a school, a city without a hospital, a country under crushing debt. We seek a better way, transparent, high standard, open access to investment that protects workers and the rule of law and the environment. It can be done and will be done,” the president said. Biden delivered his remarks even as he was grappling with an unexpected situation in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in a surprise late-night address Tuesday. The US is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the South Korean government, and Biden told reporters after his remarks that he would be getting a full briefing soon. The president also reflected on a theme that he has mentioned throughout this presidency: his belief that it’s the United States’ duty to both acknowledge and face its history. “While history can be hidden, it cannot and should not be erased. It should be faced. It’s our duty to face our history. The good, the bad and the ugly. The whole truth. That’s what great nations do,” he said. Biden’s speech comes during what likely could be his last trip abroad as president and as he seeks to deepen relationships with Angola and other African nations at a time when China has made significant inroads in the continent with hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investments, far outpacing the US. During his remarks, Biden touted US efforts to expand its relationships across Africa, including billions of dollars in investments in Angola. He also announced over $1 billion in new US humanitarian assistance for Africans who have been displaced by historic droughts across the continent. “But we know African leaders and citizens are seeking more than just aid. You seek investment. So, the United States is expanding its relationships all across Africa,” Biden said, adding later: “Moving from patrons to partners.” Biden on Monday met briefly with Wanda Tucker, who is a descendant of William Tucker, the first enslaved child born in the United States. William Tucker’s parents, Anthony and Isabella, were taken on a Portuguese ship from Angola to colonial Virginia in 1619. Wanda Tucker now serves as the faculty chair of psychology, philosophy and religious studies at Rio Salado College in Arizona. “It was the beginning of slavery in the United States. Cruel. Brutal. Dehumanizing. Our nation’s original sin. Original sin. One that’s haunted America and cast a long shadow ever since,” Biden said during his Tuesday remarks as he honored the Tucker family. “Here with us today are three Americans who are direct descendants of Anthony and Isabella, those first enslaved … Africans in America.” Ahead of his remarks, the president also met with Angolan leaders, including young people and members of civil society, at the museum. Biden started his day with a bilateral meeting with Angolan President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço at the presidential palace in Luanda. The two men discussed trade and infrastructure, including the US and Europe’s investment in the Lobito Corridor, an unfinished 800-mile railway project meant to facilitate the transfer of critical minerals from interior countries to western ports for exports. They also discussed mutual security interests as Angola has played a key mediating role in the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. But Biden’s three-day trip to Angola, the first for a sitting US president, has at times been overshadowed by the president’s decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden, a move that drew swift backlash from members of his own Democratic Party on Capitol Hill. The president has not responded to reporters’ questions relating to the pardon during the trip."

         "Democrats left fuming over Biden’s decision to pardon his son — after he repeatedly said he wouldn’t | CNN Politics",
         "2024-12-03",
         "President Joe Biden’s decision to pardon his son has left some Democrats fuming over his choice to repeatedly and unequivocally claim that he would never take that step, even though a pardon long appeared possible to Hunter Biden’s legal team. Multiple officials who recently worked for Joe Biden said they never believed the president or White House aides speaking on his behalf when they insisted in recent months that a pardon for Hunter Biden was off the table. “Anyone who was even close to the top knew that he was probably going to do this. Why did we pretend otherwise?” a former senior West Wing aide said. A different former senior White House official said they and others around them had felt “certain” the president would ultimately pardon his son, while another ex-administration official put it this way: “It was extremely, painfully obvious that this was where things would end up.” But even as some of Joe Biden’s closest allies were bewildered by the president’s eleventh-hour pardon, Hunter Biden and his lawyers long believed that one was possible, multiple sources told CNN. That comes despite the White House saying that a final decision on the pardon was reached only this weekend. The president’s Sunday evening move to announce the pardon came after he spent time with his family, including Hunter, in Nantucket, Massachusetts, over the Thanksgiving holiday and has led lawmakers in Biden’s own party to criticize him. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said as recently as November 7 that a pardon for Hunter Biden was not being considered. Joe Biden’s decision to pardon his son presented a delicate balancing act for the president, who has long been fiercely loyal to his family, even when it comes at his own personal or political detriment. Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury in June of illegally buying and possessing a gun as a drug user, after a gut-wrenching trial that delved into his drug abuse and family dysfunction. He then pleaded guilty in September to nine tax offenses, stemming from $1.4 million in taxes that he didn’t pay while spending lavishly on escorts, strippers, cars and drugs. Sources familiar with Hunter Biden’s legal strategy said he would not have agreed to plead guilty in September to all nine charges in the federal tax case — exposing himself to the possibility of 17 years in prison and more than $1 million in fines — without the expectation of clemency. The legal pressure on Hunter Biden mounted as his sentencing dates in December neared. People close to the president’s son said they didn’t want him to have to undergo sentencing. In the days before the pardon was issued, Hunter Biden’s attorneys circulated a 50-page document outlining the six-year investigation of the president’s son and blaming Donald Trump and Republican allies for being the driving force behind his legal problems. Though controversial, Joe Biden’s move to pardon a close family member or associate is not unheard of. Presidents from both parties have wielded their pardon power in ways that have raised eyebrows — though perhaps none did so after so strongly saying they would not, as Biden did. Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, his daughter’s father-in-law, on his last month in office. President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger, who had pleaded guilty to a drug charge, on his last day in office. Biden’s public reversal this weekend and the issuance of a sweeping “full and unconditional” pardon for his son has some Democrats wondering why he had maintained that he wouldn’t take a course of action that had seemed simply inevitable to so many around the president. “As a father, I get it,” Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat, said on X. “But as someone who wants people to believe in public service again, it’s a setback.” Another Democrat, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, said Biden’s decision placed “personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans’ faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all.” Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona said that while he respects the president, “I think he got this one wrong.” “This wasn’t a politically-motivated prosecution,” Stanton said on X. “Hunter committed felonies, and was convicted by a jury of his peers.” One former administration official suggested the blowback Monday would have been less intense had Biden not been adamant for months that he wasn’t seeking a pardon for his son. “I wonder if there was a way to just be less righteous about it, and more like: ‘We’re not spending our time thinking about that,’” the former administration official said. The ex-senior West Wing aide echoed that sentiment, saying there were multiple ways Biden could have left the door open to a pardon rather than ruling out its possibility altogether. “Could he have been super honest?” they asked. “Like, ‘Hey, I don’t know, I can’t answer that right now.’” Jean-Pierre, who on more than one occasion had told reporters that Biden would not pardon his son, admitted Monday that Trump’s victory in last month’s election had been a factor. “It is a no — I can answer that, it’s a no,” Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One, when asked whether Biden would have pardoned his son if Vice President Kamala Harris had won the election. But she then proceeded to insist she was not interested in discussing an event that did not happen: “I can speak to where we are today, and so I can’t speak to hypotheticals here. Where we are today, the president made this decision over the weekend.”"

         "Biden fades from view as he exits the world stage | CNN Politics",
         "2024-11-19",
         "President Joe Biden’s exit from the world stage this week was less of a dramatic mic drop and more of a slow fade from view, a low-key conclusion to a lengthy foreign policy career whose legacy is now under threat by Donald Trump. Not quite a valedictory tour, Biden’s swing through South America was overshadowed by the incoming administration, with fellow leaders turning their attention and concern to Mar-a-Lago and the string of controversial picks Trump has made for his Cabinet. In back-hallway conversations at summits in Peru and Brazil, delegations whispered among themselves about the incoming American team, looking for clues of what the next four years will hold. Biden was able to offer his counterparts few assurances; it wasn’t clear many were even looking for them. Instead, the president and his team tried to use the trip to highlight accomplishments that many leaders and US officials now fear could be reversed or simply forgotten amid the change in administrations. Even as he worked to burnish his legacy, however, Biden elected not to speak at length about his record or the new world his counterparts are about to enter. A statement delivered from the Amazon rainforest about his climate accomplishments ran only seven minutes; it was the longest address of his trip. As he concluded his final speech to the G20 leaders Tuesday, warning them that “history is watching” as they make decisions on climate change, Biden cut himself off — choosing to leave unsaid the obvious reality that US climate policy would change drastically come January. “And I’m not going to say anymore. I have much more to say, but I’m not going to,” he told the heads of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations. “But thank you for focusing on this issue. I really think is the existential issue humanity faces.” Biden takes his diminished role in stride Joined by his daughter and granddaughter, Biden seemed to take his diminished position in stride, evincing little wistfulness as he bid farewell to fellow leaders with whom he’s spent the last four years working alongside. Some, like China’s Xi Jinping, he’s known much longer. Behind closed doors, the two men put down their notes at the end of a two-hour meeting Saturday to reflect on their lengthy relationship and their willingness to get blunt about where they disagreed. But even Xi appeared ready to move on to Trump as their talks got underway, issuing a loosely veiled warning to the incoming president and his team of national security hawks. “Make the wise choice,” he said, sitting across from Biden in a vast conference room at the hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying. “Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.” A botched photo op Monday that left Biden and a handful of other leaders out of a group picture only furthered the impression of a world moving on. As leaders including Xi, India’s Narendra Modi and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan all grasped hands and smiled for cameras, Biden was still inside talking with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Photographers urged organizers to delay the picture, calling out that Biden and others were missing. But the leaders dispersed, leaving Biden to confer with two of his aides afterward. The moment was a fluke, the type of logistical error that’s almost inevitable at gatherings of almost two dozen world leaders. Yet it was difficult to ignore the impression it left: that Biden is disappearing from view as the world turns its attention to his successor. Trump takes the spotlight Already, Trump has received invitations from leaders eager to host him on a presidential visit once he takes office. In a congratulatory call, Erdogan invited the president-elect to visit his country in person, a bid to try to reset ties between the countries after tensions flared over trade and human rights during Trump’s first term. In a video of the call posted on X, Indonesia’s president offered to fly anywhere to congratulate Trump in person. “I’d like to also get to your country some time,” Trump told him. And Argentina’s president, Javier Milei — who held up work on a joint communique at the G20 this week over language around taxing the ultra-wealthy — became the first world leader to greet Trump in person following his election victory, attending a black-tie dinner at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and joining members with a dance to Trump rally anthem “YMCA.” Biden’s aides this week have tried to avoid getting sucked into questions about the incoming administration’s intentions. They have refused to comment on even the most controversial selections Trump has made for his Cabinet, despite concerns from some world leaders at some of the names — including former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who Trump chose to oversee intelligence agencies, and Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick to head the Pentagon. What members of Biden’s team have been willing to acknowledge is how little they actually know about what Trump and his team may be planning. “The incoming administration is not in the business of providing us assurances about anything,” Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in Peru. “They’ll make their own decisions as they go forward.” A senior administration official speaking after Biden’s speech in the rainforest was blunter when asked whether Trump would continue sending American funding to help preserve the Amazon. “Who knows?” the official said. “Maybe he’ll come down here and see the forest and see the damage being done from drought and other things and change his mind about climate change.” Biden tries to keep the focus on his legacy Biden himself has used his brief public appearances to pressure leaders into maintaining the projects he worked on, even after he exits the world stage. During a visit to the Amazon rainforest — which the White House was quick to point out was a first for a sitting American president — he warned his successor against scrapping climate initiatives passed over the last four years. “It’s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America. But nobody, nobody can reverse it. Nobody,” Biden said, wearing a blue outdoor shirt in the sweltering Amazon heat. But as he turned around and walked down a dirt path lined with lush foliage, Biden declined to answer any questions — about his climate initiatives or anything else. In fact, Biden’s final set of summits represents the first major gathering of leaders where he’s declined to take questions from the press in a formal setting — a departure from his predecessors and his own tradition while in office. In the Amazon rainforest, Biden delivered a short speech to a small pool of reporters before exiting the lectern silently. In Lima and Rio de Janiero, Biden fielded no questions from the press and his aides spoke only off-camera. It’s a departure from Biden’s own tradition: Over the last four years, Biden and his team have preferred to hold news conferences while on foreign soil or while flanked at the White House by an allied leader. The latter format traditionally allows at least four questions from domestic and overseas press. No news conference Biden held news conferences at all four gatherings of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations during his term and in conjunction with every annual summit of NATO leaders; in 2023, the event was held with the president of Finland, NATO’s newest member. Reporters had opportunities to ask Biden questions at the G20 summit in Rome in 2021, in Bali in 2022, and in Vietnam in 2023, following the summit’s conclusion in India the prior day. At the time, Sullivan blamed India’s Modi for withholding press access on-site at the G20 itself. During a state visit to France in June, Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron delivered joint statements from the Elysée in Paris. At the time, officials had suggested that fielding questions from reporters — one week before Biden was scheduled to do so at the G7 summit — would be “duplicative,” according to a person briefed on the discussions. Four months later, Biden pursued the same format with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on a visit to Berlin. By contrast, then-President Barack Obama, following the election of Trump in 2016, took two opportunities while overseas to defend his record, acknowledge the change sought by the electorate and stake out what he saw as the US’ position in the world. Speaking from the Lima Convention Center, the very same venue where Biden attended the APEC summit last week, Obama argued for enduring American leadership even in the the era of Trump. “The American president and the United States of America — if we’re not on the side of what’s right, if we’re not making the argument and fighting for it, even if sometimes we’re not able to deliver at 100% everywhere — then it collapses,” Obama argued. “And there’s nobody to fill the void.”"

         "Biden makes first presidential visit to the Amazon as incoming Trump administration poses a threat to climate fight | CNN Politics",
         "2024-11-17",
         "When President Joe Biden worked to burnish his climate legacy in the Brazilian Amazon on Sunday, the unspoken presence of Donald Trump shadowed the historic stop. A sitting American president had never before set foot in the Amazon rainforest, and Biden wanted to use his presence in the vital environment to bring attention to his efforts curbing carbon emissions and helping the world guard against global warming. Standing on a dirt path with lush palms and other foliage behind him, Biden described the fight against climate change as a “defining” part of his presidency. But he also warned future administrations that undoing that work would risk depriving the world of its benefits. Without naming President-elect Trump, who has questioned whether climate change exists and vowed to reverse Biden policies on gas and oil exploration, Biden delivered a clear message to the country as he prepares to make way for the incoming Republican president. “I will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on if they choose to do so. It’s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America. But nobody, nobody can reverse it. Nobody,” Biden said in remarks from Manaus, Brazil. “Not when so many people regardless of party or politics are enjoying its benefits. Not when countries around the world are harnessing the clean energy revolution to pull ahead themselves. The question now is: Which government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous economic opportunity?” he continued. Before he spoke, Biden viewed dried-up river beds and wildfire damage on an aerial tour of the Amazon rainforest, getting a bird’s-eye view of some of the effects of a yearslong drought. The half-hour tour aboard Marine One brought Biden to the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon rivers, where he saw ships that had been grounded due to low water levels, and over a wildlife preserve. Among the moves he announced Sunday were tens of millions in US dollars directed toward preserving the Amazon, whose trees act as a sponge for massive amounts of carbon dioxide and which is being threatened by deforestation. And he pledged billions to help nations bolster resilience against climate change. But whether any of the money makes it out the door will now largely be up to Trump, who has dismissed climate change — and who, a day before Biden’s trip, named a fracking industry executive as his pick for energy secretary. Trump has already vowed to withdraw again from the Paris climate accord, which Biden entered back into when he took office four years ago. Trump and his team have pledged to ease restrictions on oil and gas exploration that Biden put in place. And the president-elect has cast a deeply skeptical eye toward foreign assistance of the type Biden announced Sunday. That dynamic has led to skepticism among world leaders gathered for summits in South America this month that any of Biden’s announcements will last past January, when he exits the world stage. The stakes of the Amazon’s fate could hardly be higher. Aside from its role absorbing planet-warming gasses, the rainforest accounts for a major portion of the world’s biodiversity and is home to Indigenous populations."

         "Trump looms over Biden’s final meeting with Xi in Peru | CNN Politics",
         "2024-11-16",
         "President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, closed the book on their diplomatic relationship Saturday, meeting for a final time amid uncertainty over what the next Donald Trump presidency might portend for their two countries’ ties. As they opened the talks on the sidelines of the APEC summit of Pacific leaders in Lima, both men described the relationship between Washington and Beijing as “the most important” in the entire world, one that could quickly tilt into global conflict if not carefully managed. Behind closed doors, the leaders hashed out a range of contentious issues that will undoubtedly continue into the next administration. As the talks concluded, the men put down their notes for a moment of reflection on what has been a lengthy and layered relationship. For his part, Xi said he was prepared to maintain stable ties once Biden exits the world stage. Left largely unspoken were the deep questions about what Trump intends to do when he takes office in 65 days. “The United States has recently concluded its elections,” Xi told Biden through a translator. “China’s goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged.” “Make the wise choice,” Xi said, somewhat ominously. “Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.” The comments amounted to as clear a sign as any that China is now looking past Biden toward his successor. After more than a decade of encounters, the moment was likely the last time Biden and Xi will meet before Trump is inaugurated in January. Xi didn’t mention Trump by name, but his opening comments suggested a degree of concern about what the incoming administration might have in store. “China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences, so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-US relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,” Xi said. Biden used the meeting to raise a series of contentious issues with Xi one last time, including Taiwan, the economy, Ukraine and fentanyl production. The leaders also reached a new agreement that artificial intelligence never be allowed to replace human control of nuclear weapons. Biden acknowledged the relationship had seen its “ups and downs” since he took office. But it was also a moment for reflection on a relationship that began more than a decade ago, over a long meal in Chengdu. That was an episode that left deep impressions on the president, at least judging by how often he recounts it. A search of Biden’s speeches over the past four years finds 61 instances of him describing a moment at the end of the evening when, asked by Xi to define America, he came up with a single word: possibilities. He brought up the dinner again as he prepared to say farewell to Xi for a final time. “I remember being on the Tibetan plateau with you, and I remember being in Beijing and all over the world, first as vice president and then as president,” Biden said. “We haven’t always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We have never kidded one another. We’ve been level with one another. And I think that’s vital.” In the end, looking backward may be more productive for Biden and Xi than trying to predict what’s next for their two nations. Trump’s return to the White House has been the overwhelming backdrop to the summit of Pacific leaders in Lima this week, as delegates discuss and strategize for an uncertain future. Trump’s embrace of tariffs, autocrats and isolationist viewpoints runs mostly counter to the foreign policy principles Biden spent the past four years espousing on the world stage. Yet Trump’s unpredictability might be the most disconcerting for the leaders gathered in Lima. That includes Xi, who regularly encourages stability above all else in his public pronouncements. Still scarred from a chaotic first administration and looking for clues of whether Trump will adopt a more level approach during his second go-around, world leaders have not been encouraged by the Cabinet selections emerging from Mar-a-Lago. Talk of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth and former Rep. Matt Gaetz has permeated even the back hallways of the Lima Convention Center, where the APEC summit is convening. Preparing for Trump In some ways, Trump is hardly a mystery to Xi and his Chinese advisers, who spent four years dealing with him before Biden entered office. But like most of Trump’s policy choices, how he chooses to approach the world’s most consequential bilateral relationship this time around is anyone’s guess. With just two months until Trump is inaugurated, top Chinese Communist Party officials have been trying to glean from foreign policy experts whether his campaign rhetoric will translate into his real agenda, according to people involved in the conversations. The questions Chinese officials are raising, these people say, include Trump’s proposed hikes to his sweeping tariff programs; his posture toward Taiwan; his relationship with the leaders of Japan and South Korea; and the military footprint he plans to pursue in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing has also taken stock of the China hawks with whom Trump plans to staff his Cabinet — including Sen. Marco Rubio at the State Department and Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. And Chinese officials are openly speculating on whether alternate channels of communication to Trump — through Elon Musk, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, or Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — might help them soften the hardline stance the personnel selections have promoted. There are signs pointing toward a more aggressive stance, including his hawkish choices for top national security roles. He’s promised vast 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, a move that would inject new volatility into an already contentious relationship. But there’s also the memory of his attempts at cultivating a relationship with Xi during his first administration, hoping to secure trade agreements and improve other areas of cooperation. Ultimately, Trump and Xi inked a trade deal in which China agreed, among other things, to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars in American goods, which it never ended up buying. The trade disputes, along with Xi’s attempts at obscuring the origins of the coronavirus, eventually soured ties between the two men. How Trump proceeds could have wide implications for the region and world. Those stakes aside, there was little Biden could say to Xi that would likely reassure him of smooth Washington-Beijing ties in the years ahead. Biden administration officials acknowledge they have little insight into what a notoriously unpredictable leader might be planning. In the meeting Saturday, Biden didn’t attempt to predict what might happen to the US-China relationship once he exits office in January, nor did he act as a conduit for messages between Xi and the incoming administration. His national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, acknowledged afterward that the Trump transition team “is not in the business of providing us assurances about anything.” “It’s our job to do all that we can to set the new administration up as effectively as possible, and then they will decide how they’ll take things forward,” Sullivan said. Instead, Biden in the meeting sought to underscore with Xi the importance of maintaining honest and straightforward lines of communication. “What has made the relationship between the two of them function effectively is that they’re able to be very straight with one another, even disagree, and that level of candor, directness — even bluntness, at times — has been critical in helping see us through some choppy waters at times,” Sullivan said. An opportunity to look back on a consequential relationship Unlike the leaders’ previous two meetings — on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Bali and at an estate outside San Francisco — the Lima talks weren’t expected to result in a major list of outcomes. The men were expected to talk about the usual topics — including Taiwan, Ukraine, fentanyl production and human rights — along with some new irritations, namely China’s alleged efforts to hack Trump’s cellphone along with other devices associated with his campaign. But it was mostly an opportunity to look back on what has been a lengthy and somewhat complicated relationship. For Xi, the meeting with Biden represented a delicate endeavor. Meeting with the outgoing US president is a way to show respect for the office and signal stability in the relationship, but major negotiations will loom with Trump once he takes over in January. “The upside is tiny and the downside is enormous if Trump thinks they’re stealing his thunder or (the two leaders) are making deals that would tie Trump’s hands,” said one source familiar with the dynamic. The two men came to know each other when each was serving as vice president. When it became clear Xi — then something of a mystery to American officials — was poised to take over leadership in China, Biden was dispatched by the Obama administration to take his temperature. Biden likes to brag that he’s traveled tens of thousands of miles with Xi, and that among his fellow world leaders he’s spent the most time with him. And while that may have been true at one point, Xi has clearly turned his attention to deepening his relationship with another leader: Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The “no limits” partnership the two men declared earlier in Biden’s term has concerned US, European and Asian officials alike, who see a growing anti-West partnership between China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as one of the biggest future security threats. Already, the US has assessed China is sending tools and technology to Russia to produce missiles, aircraft and tanks used in its war against Ukraine. And revelations that Pyongyang has sent troops to Russia for fighting in Ukraine have loomed over talks in Peru this week. A key counterweight could be Biden’s legacy How Trump confronts those threats is not something he’s discussed at great length, at least as a candidate. Speaking Friday, Biden acknowledged the world faces “a moment of significant political change” as he hailed a strengthened three-way partnership between the United States, Japan and South Korea. Biden’s efforts to bring Tokyo and Seoul into closer partnership after years of historical acrimony amount to a major facet of his legacy in East Asia and his attempt to create counterweight to China. It’s also an area his aides believe could — and should — be continued by the incoming Trump administration, though they acknowledge they have little to go on when it comes to the president-elect’s intentions. Biden conceded Friday the meeting between himself, South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol and Japan’s new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, was likely to be his last such encounter before he steps aside in January. But he said his efforts to bring the three nations closer — after years of historical acrimony and tensions — would endure. “I think it’s built to last,” he said. “It’s my hope and expectation.” This story has been updated with new reporting."

         "Biden set to meet with world leaders who have already moved on to Trump | CNN Politics",
         "2024-11-14",
         "When President Joe Biden’s aides were planning his visit to South America this week for a pair of leaders’ summits, two vastly different scenarios were in play. In one, Biden arrived as the confident statesman burnishing a legacy and preparing to hand off to his vice president. In the other, he was faced with anxious world leaders and fresh questions about whether, as he’d spent four years claiming, “America was back.” He wanted the first. He got the latter. Denied a victory lap on the world stage, Biden will instead use his time in Peru and Brazil this week for reflection and looking ahead. No longer viewed on the world stage as the American president who defeated Donald Trump — and his “America First” ideology — for good, Biden will find himself amid leaders who are already moving on. Many of his counterparts have pivoted to cultivating — or in many cases recultivating — relationships with Trump, angling for meetings in Palm Beach while they are in the hemisphere. The summits carry an inevitable awkwardness given the short time Biden has left in office and the sea change that awaits when he leaves. Leaders are talking among themselves about how to insulate their economies and respond to the threats Trump has already put forth, but Biden administration officials have been largely excluded from those conversations. “It’s very clear that’s all they’re thinking about,” said a senior US official. Despite leaders gathering in Lima and Rio de Janeiro, “all anyone can think about is what’s happening in DC.” Aside from the summits’ hosts, Biden will meet only one other leader one-on-one: President Xi Jinping of China. He will hold trilateral talks with the leaders of Japan and South Korea, the latter of whom said this week he was dusting off his golf clubs in preparation for a potential round with Trump. Biden’s entourage will represent slimmed-down staffing from prior foreign trips, with a relatively light schedule and low stakes – and the desire of many to begin searching for new jobs. Traditionally, the APEC and G20 summits that Biden attends this weekend are moments for American presidents to confer with potential trading partners and military allies to collectively confront a host of global issues. Trump, however, disliked these types of summits and quizzed aides beforehand at the necessity of attending. Biden, who met with Trump for two hours Wednesday at the White House, isn’t likely to be able to offer a great deal of reassurance to allies who wonder what’s in store for the next four years. Nor is it clear whether foreign leaders will be all that interested in his perspective. Despite his proud declarations during his first trip abroad in 2021 that “America is back” after the Trump years, it is now evident that a majority of American voters chose an alternative path in Trump, whose first presidency caused strained alliances and prompted questions about US leadership. As Biden was preparing to depart following his meeting with Trump, his top national security aide said his message to the world wouldn’t change, despite Trump’s election. “He is going to have the same message that he’s had for four years as president, which is that he believes that America’s allies are vital to America’s national security. They make us stronger. They multiply our capability. They take a burden off of our shoulders,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. “He is going to be making the case to our allies and, frankly, to our adversaries that America is standing with its alliances, investing in its alliances,” he went on. “That will be his message. It’s a message of principle. It’s a message of practicality. And it’s been one of the causes of President Biden’s life.” On the ground, leaders of both APEC and G20 countries are expected to promote initiatives that would allow developing countries to invest more favorably at home at lower borrowing rates to prevent being overleveraged to countries like China. And the US is expected to tout more robust development financing by the World Bank, from which Trump acolytes have threatened to withdraw. “Some in the Trump administration may not care for that,” a senior administration official said of empowering more grants from the World Bank. “But it’s a very good way to make sure problems don’t wash up on our shores.” But elsewhere, US officials aren’t trying to lock other nations into agreements or partnerships to try to front-run the new administration. Allies have expressed gratitude for Biden’s predictable leadership but are now bracing for the tsunami of Trump. “We’re not putting in poison pills,” the senior official told CNN. “Other countries wouldn’t even want to agree to anything that would get the relationship off to a rocky start with the new crowd.” What assurances Biden can offer that would hold after January 20 aren’t clear. Ultimately, Biden’s counterparts were never entirely confident in his insistence that America would not return to those days. Even when he told members of the G7 that America was back, their first question was: “For how long?” In Europe, waves of populism led leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron to take a skeptical eye toward any of Biden’s assurances that Trump’s brand of politics was a thing of the past. He spent much of Biden’s presidency arguing for a more self-sufficient Europe that could provide for its own defense, a mission that’s only escalated since Trump’s election. After Biden withdrew from the presidential race this summer, many of his counterparts sent warm messages thanking him for his leadership. But privately, many who had encountered Biden up close at summits and meetings over the previous year – and witnessed what they said were clear signs of age – wondered how he could have mounted a reelection bid in the first place. Biden is not the first incumbent Democrat to travel to Peru following a Trump victory. Then-President Barack Obama traveled to the same summit in the same city following Trump’s shock victory in 2016 and found himself confronted by Pacific nation leaders eager for some guidance on where US foreign policy might be headed next. Among those most interested was Xi, who asked Obama at the end of a long meeting about the incoming president-elect. Obama suggested he wait and see how Trump operated once in office. “We prefer to have a good relationship with the United States,” Xi responded, according to an account in a book by Ben Rhodes, a top Obama aide. “That is good for the world. But every action will have a reaction. And if an immature leader throws the world into chaos, then the world will know whom to blame.” Xi will meet Biden on Saturday in Lima for what officials describe as a “bookend conversation” closing out Biden’s time in office. But having dealt with Trump for four years already, it’s not clear how much advice Xi will need this time."

         "Biden to meet for a final time with Xi this week as a new Trump era of China relations begins | CNN Politics",
         "2024-11-13",
         "President Joe Biden will meet for a final time this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping as he prepares to hand over power — and the reins of the world’s most consequential bilateral relationship — to President-elect Donald Trump in January. The meeting, set for Saturday on the sidelines of a summit of Pacific leaders in Peru, serves as a bookend to the president’s high stakes attempts to position the US against an increasingly assertive Beijing. It will be the third sit-down between the two leaders since Biden took office. Unlike their previous meetings, the Lima talks won’t result in a long list of takeaways or deliverables. Instead, senior US officials described the meeting as a moment for reflection between two men whose relationship began more than a decade ago on a lengthy trip through China. For all of the reminiscing Biden and Xi may do, however, their final encounter will be shadowed by the results of last week’s election. Trump enters office having promised a hard line on China and has already placed a string of China hawks in key positions ahead of his swearing-in in January, portending a contentious relationship in the years ahead. How that approach will materially differ from Biden’s remains to be seen, given the current administration has taken aggressive steps to limit Chinese technology and to bolster American alliances in Asia as a counter to Beijing. In agreeing to meet with Biden in his lame-duck period, Xi appears to be signaling a desire to maintain continuity and relative stability amid the US leadership transition. Still, Biden administration officials acknowledged they couldn’t predict what direction the US-China relationship would take once Biden left office. But they maintained hope the approach Biden adopted might work for Trump as well. “This is a tough, complicated relationship between the US and China, and so whatever the next administration decides, they are going to need to find ways to manage that tough, complicated relationship,” one senior administration official said. Biden officials believe maintaining robust communication channels and engaging in “tough conversations” across the Chinese government has helped mitigate certain misunderstandings between the two superpowers. But Biden will still hand off a series of contentious issues to Trump when he departs office. “Russia, cross-strait issues, South China Sea, and cyber are areas the next administration is going to need to think about carefully, because those are areas of deep policy difference with China, and I don’t expect that will disappear,” the official said. The final meeting between the leaders of the world’s largest economies comes at a precarious global moment. Since Biden entered office, Xi has deepened his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin while also maintaining strong ties with Iran and North Korea, creating an anti-US network that has generated increasing concern in Washington. American officials have also watched with alarm as China conducts aggressive military exercises around Taiwan, leading to worries Beijing could move on the self-governing island in the next few years. How Trump approaches the new world reality remains to be seen. Trump attempted to cultivate strong ties with Xi early in his first presidency, but their relationship soured amid trade disputes and the origins of Covid-19. Trump and Xi spoke last week, CNN reported, as the Chinese leader looks to ascertain what the next four years will hold. As he builds out his administration, Trump has selected advisers who advocate a tough approach to China, including Rep. Mike Waltz to serve as national security adviser and potentially Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state. Trump has also vowed to impose tough tariffs on Chinese imports as a way to protect American industry. The moves suggest a confrontational approach to Beijing will be in the offing, making Biden’s final meeting with his counterpart a moment to discuss the path forward. Biden has placed communication at the center of the Xi relationship, prioritizing regular phone calls and meetings as a way to ensure no miscommunications. He’s also found some areas for cooperation, including on fentanyl trafficking and climate change. He’s also poured money into American attempts at competing with China on the global stage through infrastructure investments in the developing world. Even ahead of the meetings, however, shifting global power dynamics have been on display. While in Peru, Xi inaugurated a $1.3 billion port, an extension of China’s efforts at making inroads across the southern hemisphere. Saturday’s meeting also has some symmetry to the last time Trump took office. Almost exactly eight years ago in one of his final foreign trips, former President Barack Obama met with Xi also in Lima just after Trump had been elected to the presidency the first time. Former Obama foreign policy adviser Ben Rhodes wrote about that 2016 meeting in his book “The World As It Is: A Memoir of the Obama White House,” writing that Xi asked Obama about the president-elect. “Toward the end of the meeting, Xi asked about Trump. Again, Obama suggested that the Chinese wait and see what the new administration decided to do in office, but he noted that the president-elect had tapped into real concerns among Americans about the fairness of our economic relationship with China,” Rhodes wrote. “Sitting across the table from Obama, he pushed aside the binder of talking points that usually shape the words of a Chinese leader. ‘We prefer to have a good relationship with the United States,’ he said, folding his hands in front of him. ‘That is good for the world. But every action will have a reaction. And if an immature leader throws the world into chaos, then the world will know whom to blame,’” Rhodes continued."
